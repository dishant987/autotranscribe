Hey, everyone. I'm Alex. Thanks for clicking. You are learning English with www.engvid.com. That's www.engvid.com.

2
00:00:10,880 --> 00:00:21,680
Today, we are going to practice our listening and comprehension skills. In this lesson, you will hear four scenarios.

3
00:00:21,680 --> 00:00:30,320
At the beginning of each scenario, I will give you three questions. As you listen to each scenario,

4
00:00:30,320 --> 00:00:39,600
keep these questions in your mind because we will review them at the end of each of the four listening

5
00:00:39,600 --> 00:00:48,960
scenarios. As a bonus listening practice, I will also give you one extra question at the end of each

6
00:00:48,960 --> 00:00:56,080
scenario that will not be on the board, so this is just a way for you to get some extra practice.

7
00:00:56,800 --> 00:01:06,000
Now, this is a listening lesson, so please feel free to pause, to rewind, and also to read the

8
00:01:06,000 --> 00:01:13,840
transcript when you are finished with the lesson. And if you enjoy this lesson, at the end,

9
00:01:13,840 --> 00:01:22,480
make sure to check out the quiz on engvid.com for some extra listening practice. The questions will

10
00:01:22,480 --> 00:01:29,920
be different from the questions you hear in this video. So, let's not waste any more time.

11
00:01:29,920 --> 00:01:39,040
Here we go with scenario number one. As you listen to scenario number one, keep these questions

12
00:01:39,040 --> 00:01:51,440
in mind. Number one, how old is Thomas? Number two, what is Thomas' job? And number three,

13
00:01:52,320 --> 00:01:59,920
what does Thomas want to do in the future? And don't forget, at the end of this scenario,

14
00:01:59,920 --> 00:02:07,840
I will give you an extra question, so listen carefully. Now, listen to the scenario.

15
00:02:09,360 --> 00:02:18,720
My name is Thomas. I live in Edmonton, Alberta with my dog Rusty. My birthday is on May 18th,

16
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:26,640
and I am 32 years old. When I was a kid, I wanted to become a soccer player,

17
00:02:27,360 --> 00:02:34,960
but I changed my mind as I got older. Now, I work as an accountant for a shoe company

18
00:02:34,960 --> 00:02:41,840
in downtown Edmonton. I have been working there for five years, and I like it a lot.

19
00:02:42,880 --> 00:02:50,080
I'm still single, but I don't mind. I like my freedom, and Rusty keeps me company.

20
00:02:50,800 --> 00:02:58,000
One day, I want to drive across Canada. I think Rusty and I would have a great time on the

21
00:02:58,000 --> 00:03:09,360
open road. Now, it's your turn to answer the questions. To review, number one, how old is Thomas?

22
00:03:09,360 --> 00:03:24,800
The answer, Thomas is 32 years old. Number two, what is Thomas' job?

23
00:03:24,800 --> 00:03:42,560
The answer, Thomas is an accountant. Number three, what does Thomas want to do in the future?

24
00:03:42,560 --> 00:03:49,840
He wants to drive across Canada.

25
00:03:49,840 --> 00:03:59,760
And now, for the bonus question, let's see if you paid attention, and let's test your memory.

26
00:04:00,720 --> 00:04:06,720
When he was a kid, what did Thomas want to become?

27
00:04:13,360 --> 00:04:19,120
You can go back and listen again if you need to. I'm going to give you the answer now.

28
00:04:20,080 --> 00:04:29,360
When he was a kid, Thomas wanted to become a soccer player. So remember, you can always rewind

29
00:04:29,360 --> 00:04:36,720
the lesson, you can turn on closed captioning, and you can also read the transcript on YouTube

30
00:04:36,720 --> 00:04:44,640
to double check your answers if you're not 100% sure. Now, let's move on to scenario number two.

31
00:04:44,640 --> 00:04:54,240
As you listen to scenario two, keep these questions in mind. Number one, what did the narrator

32
00:04:54,240 --> 00:05:05,360
give Tina when Tina came downstairs? Number two, where did Tina want to go after school?

33
00:05:07,120 --> 00:05:17,280
Number three, which card game did they play in the evening? Now, listen to the scenario.

34
00:05:17,840 --> 00:05:27,280
Yesterday was a busy day. It was my daughter Tina's birthday. So I woke up early and prepared her

35
00:05:27,280 --> 00:05:35,600
favorite breakfast, waffles and strawberries with chocolate sauce. When Tina got out of bed and

36
00:05:35,600 --> 00:05:45,680
came downstairs, I gave her a huge hug and said happy birthday. A few minutes later, my wife got up

37
00:05:45,680 --> 00:05:53,120
and joined us at the kitchen table. While the three of us ate, we talked about our plans for the day.

38
00:05:54,080 --> 00:06:02,080
Tina said that she wanted to go to her grandparents' house after school. So that's exactly what we did.

39
00:06:03,040 --> 00:06:11,600
In the evening, we had cake, sang happy birthday, and played Tina's favorite card game go fish.

40
00:06:12,560 --> 00:06:21,280
It was a great day. Did you catch everything? Let's ask those questions one more time.

41
00:06:22,160 --> 00:06:28,880
So, number one, what did the narrator give Tina when Tina came downstairs?

42
00:06:32,480 --> 00:06:40,320
He gave her a huge hug, right? So a hug like this? Okay. Number two,

43
00:06:41,760 --> 00:06:45,120
where did Tina want to go after school?

44
00:06:49,760 --> 00:07:02,160
She wanted to go to her grandparents' house. Number three, which card game did they play in the evening?

45
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:15,840
They played go fish. Maybe this card game has a different name in your first language if you

46
00:07:15,840 --> 00:07:22,640
have this card game in your language. But yeah, there is a card game called go fish in English.

47
00:07:22,640 --> 00:07:32,720
It's very fun, especially with kids. Okay. Number four, this is the bonus question. Let's test your

48
00:07:32,720 --> 00:07:39,120
listening. What did the father prepare for Tina in the morning?

49
00:07:40,080 --> 00:07:54,000
So, the simple answer is he prepared her favorite breakfast. Now, do you remember the specific

50
00:07:54,000 --> 00:08:03,600
breakfast that he prepared? If you do, I would be very impressed. That breakfast was waffles with

51
00:08:03,600 --> 00:08:12,080
strawberries and chocolate sauce. That's right. And again, if you're not sure, you can always rewind,

52
00:08:12,080 --> 00:08:19,600
you can pause, you can listen again, and you can read the transcript on YouTube. Now, let's

53
00:08:19,600 --> 00:08:27,840
continue to listening scenario number three. For scenario three, keep these questions in mind.

54
00:08:28,640 --> 00:08:34,880
Number one, what does the narrator do after he brushes his hair?

55
00:08:36,480 --> 00:08:42,880
Number two, what does the narrator usually do while he has breakfast?

56
00:08:44,320 --> 00:08:53,360
Number three, what does the narrator do after breakfast? Now, listen to the scenario.

57
00:08:54,000 --> 00:09:05,520
On weekdays, I usually wake up at 6 a.m. After I get out of bed, I go to the kitchen, wash my hands

58
00:09:05,520 --> 00:09:15,520
and face, brush my hair, and get dressed. Then, I go to the kitchen and put the kettle on while I

59
00:09:15,520 --> 00:09:23,680
prepare breakfast. When the water in the kettle is boiled, I make myself a coffee and bring my

60
00:09:23,680 --> 00:09:31,840
breakfast to the kitchen table. While I have breakfast, I usually check my messages and emails,

61
00:09:32,480 --> 00:09:41,200
sometimes I listen to music or to a podcast. After breakfast, I put away the dirty dishes

62
00:09:41,200 --> 00:09:46,880
and I brush my teeth. Once that's done, I'm ready to start my day.

63
00:09:48,960 --> 00:09:57,280
Okay, how is that? Let's review the questions. Number one, what does the narrator do

64
00:09:58,000 --> 00:10:00,080
after he brushes his hair?

65
00:10:00,080 --> 00:10:15,760
Number two, what does the narrator usually do while he has breakfast?

66
00:10:15,760 --> 00:10:31,440
He usually checks his messages and emails. Number three, what does the narrator do after breakfast?

67
00:10:31,440 --> 00:10:46,480
He puts away the dirty dishes and brushes his teeth. And now, the bonus question, question number four,

68
00:10:46,480 --> 00:10:58,720
what time, very simple, what time does the narrator usually wake up? This was the first sentence of the

69
00:10:58,720 --> 00:11:14,000
listening. He usually wakes up at 6am. Okay, how are you doing so far? Not bad? Good. Now, we're going to

70
00:11:14,000 --> 00:11:22,400
continue to scenario number four. This one is a little more challenging, so get ready. As you listen

71
00:11:22,480 --> 00:11:32,960
to this scenario, keep these questions in mind. Number one, what didn't Adam's bullies allow him to do?

72
00:11:34,960 --> 00:11:43,440
Number two, what did the principal say about the bullies behavior? And number three,

73
00:11:44,400 --> 00:11:54,880
how does Adam feel in his new school? So this is a slightly longer scenario, so pay careful attention.

74
00:11:55,680 --> 00:12:05,680
Here we go. When my brother Adam was younger, he hated going to school. Why? Because a group of

75
00:12:05,680 --> 00:12:13,920
kids always bullied him. And even though he tried to avoid them, they always found him and pushed him

76
00:12:13,920 --> 00:12:23,840
around at recess. They didn't even allow him to finish eating his lunch in peace. Things got so

77
00:12:23,840 --> 00:12:31,440
bad that our parents had to consider changing schools because the principal didn't feel like doing

78
00:12:31,440 --> 00:12:41,200
anything to improve the situation. It's just kids being kids, he said. I really disliked this

79
00:12:41,200 --> 00:12:49,280
lazy explanation. My parents weren't happy either, so they discussed the possibility of changing

80
00:12:49,280 --> 00:12:57,120
schools with us. Yes, I would miss playing with my friends, but I knew that I could make new

81
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:06,000
friends too. Eventually, we decided to move because staying at that school was terrible for Adam's

82
00:13:06,000 --> 00:13:14,400
mental health. Now, after just one month, our new school is a much better environment for my brother.

83
00:13:15,040 --> 00:13:23,520
He has made new friends and he feels much happier and more confident. This really was the best

84
00:13:23,520 --> 00:13:34,160
decision for our family. Did you get all of that? Now, let's review the questions. What didn't

85
00:13:34,160 --> 00:13:45,280
Adam's bullies allow him to do? They didn't allow him to finish eating his lunch in peace.

86
00:13:45,280 --> 00:13:53,920
Next, number two, what did the principal say about the bullies' behavior?

87
00:13:58,880 --> 00:14:09,760
The principal said, it's just kids being kids. Number three, how does Adam feel in his new school?

88
00:14:09,760 --> 00:14:22,960
He feels much happier and more confident. And now, number four, the bonus question, here it is,

89
00:14:24,160 --> 00:14:28,960
how did the narrator feel about the principal's explanation?

90
00:14:29,360 --> 00:14:44,160
Now, the short answer is he didn't like it. The longer answer is he didn't like it, he thought it was a lazy

91
00:14:44,160 --> 00:14:54,960
explanation. Okay, did you get all that? Great. That is everything for today's listening comprehension
